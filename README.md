# # Crowdsourced Pothole Reporter WebApp

## Overview
The **Crowdsourced Pothole Reporter WebApp** empowers citizens to report potholes and road hazards in real-time, making their communities safer. Users can snap photos, add descriptions, and pin locations on a map, with reports instantly displayed for everyone to see.

Local authorities get a dedicated dashboard to track, prioritize, and update the status of repairs, ensuring faster resolutions. The app fosters community engagement by letting users follow the progress of their reports and rewarding participation with badges and leaderboards.
